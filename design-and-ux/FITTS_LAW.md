# Fitts's Law

> "The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target."

**The Insight:**  
Big things are easy to click. Close things are easy to click. Edges of the screen are "infinitely" deep (you can't overshoot them), making them the easiest targets of all.

**In Practice:**  
Make your primary call-to-action (CTA) large. Do not bury common actions in tiny buttons. Use the corners and edges of the screen for menus (like the Windows Start button or Mac Menu Bar). If a button is destructive (Delete), make it smaller or further away to prevent accidental clicks.
