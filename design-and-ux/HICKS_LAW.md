# Hick's Law

> "The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices."

**The Insight:**  
More options = more cognitive load = slower decision making. "Analysis Paralysis" is the extreme version of this. If you give a user 20 options, they might choose none.

**In Practice:**  
Simplify. Don't show everything at once. Use "progressive disclosure" (show the basics, click 'More' for advanced). If you have a pricing page, highlight _one_ recommended option to anchor the user's decision-making process.
