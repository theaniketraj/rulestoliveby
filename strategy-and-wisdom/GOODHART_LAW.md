# Goodhart's Law

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

**The Insight:**  
Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes. If you incentivize people based on a metric, they will optimize for that metric, often at the expense of the actual goal.

**In Practice:**  
If you measure developers by "lines of code written," you will get bloated, verbose code. If you measure by "bugs fixed," you might encourage writing buggy code just to fix it later. Measure outcomes, not proxies.
