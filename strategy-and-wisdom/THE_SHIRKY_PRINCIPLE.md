# The Shirky Principle

> "Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution."

**The Insight:**  
Clay Shirky noted that organizations act to self-preserve. A tax preparation company will lobby against simpler tax codes. A sprawling IT department might resist a SaaS solution that makes their server management skills obsolete.

**In Practice:**  
Be aware of misaligned incentives. If you are asking a team to automate themselves out of a job, they will find reasons why the automation is "impossible" or "unsafe." You must change the incentive structure (e.g., "You will lead the new automation team") to get buy-in.
