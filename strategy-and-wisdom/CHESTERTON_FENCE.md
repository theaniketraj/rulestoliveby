# Chesterton's Fence

> "Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put there in the first place."

**The Insight:**  
Reforms often fail because they ignore the wisdom inherent in the status quo. G.K. Chesterton described a scene where a reformer sees a fence blocking a road and says, "I don't see the use of this; let me clear it away." The intelligent reformer replies, "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

**In Practice:**  
Before refactoring that "ugly" legacy code, understand _why_ it was written that way. It might be handling a specific edge case you haven't discovered yet. Ignorance of function is not a valid reason for destruction.
