# The Law of Triviality (Bike-Shedding)

> "Organizations give disproportionate weight to trivial issues."

**The Insight:**  
C. Northcote Parkinson observed that a committee would approve a £10 million nuclear reactor in 2 minutes (because nobody understands it) but spend 45 minutes debating the color of the bike shed (because _everyone_ understands paint).

**In Practice:**  
Recognize when your meeting has descended into bike-shedding. If you are debating a simple aesthetic choice or a minor variable name for an hour, stop. Make a decision (any decision) and move on. Save your energy for the reactor.
