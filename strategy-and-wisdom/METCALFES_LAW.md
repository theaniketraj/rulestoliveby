# Metcalfe's Law

> "The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system ($n^2$)."

**The Insight:**  
A single fax machine is a paperweight. Two are a link. A million are a revolution. Network effects are the most powerful moat in business. Costs usually grow linearly ($n$), but value grows broadly exponentially (or quadratically, $n^2$). This creates a "winner-take-all" dynamic.

**In Practice:**  
When building platforms or social tools, focus entirely on "liquidity" (active users) in the beginning. The product is not the code; the product is the other users.
