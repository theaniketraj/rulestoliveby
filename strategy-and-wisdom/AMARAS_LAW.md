# Amara's Law (The Hype Cycle)

> "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run."

**The Insight:**  
Roy Amara observed the cycle of human reaction to innovation. First comes the Hype (AI, Blockchain, VR), where we expect the world to change overnight. When it doesn't, we crash into disillusionment and assume it was a failure. Meanwhile, the technology quietly matures and eventually changes the world in ways we stopped predicting.

**In Practice:**  
Don't write off a technology just because the bubble popped. That's usually the best time to invest or learn, as the noise has died down and the real utility is being built. Conversely, be skeptical of the "revolution" promised in next quarter's release.
