# The Dunning-Kruger Effect

> "The cognitive bias where people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability."

**The Insight:**  
True competence includes the ability to recognize the limits of one's own competence. Incompetence often masks itself because the skills needed to perform a task are the same skills needed to evaluate performance on that task.

**In Practice:**  
Stay humble. When you think you know everything about a new technology after a weekend tutorial, you are likely at the "Peak of Mount Stupid." Real expertise looks like "I know enough to know how much I don't know."
