# Hofstadter's Law

> "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."

**The Insight:**  
Douglas Hofstadter's recursive law captures the hopelessness of time estimation. We are optimistic by nature. Even when we pad our estimates ("I'll add 30% for safety"), the universe finds new, unexpected ways to delay us. The "unknown unknowns" are always larger than the "known unknowns."

**In Practice:**  
Estimates are probability distributions, not single numbers. Never commit to a fixed date if you can avoid it; commit to a range. Break work down into the smallest possible chunks to reduce the variance of the "unknowns."
