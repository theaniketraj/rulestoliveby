# Reed's Law

> "The utility of large networks, particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with the size of the network ($2^N$)."

**The Insight:**  
David P. Reed argued that Metcalfe's Law ($n^2$) underestimates the value of group-forming networks. The real value isn't just one-to-one connections, but the ability to form subgroups. Since the number of possible subgroups is $2^N$, the value of a network like Slack or Reddit (where groups form) grows much faster than a network like a telephone system.

**In Practice:**  
If building a network, give users tools to self-organize. Let them create channels, groups, and sub-communities. This unleashes the exponential value of Reed's Law, making your platform incredibly sticky.
