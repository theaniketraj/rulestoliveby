# The Law of the Instrument

> "If the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."

**The Insight:**  
Attributed to Abraham Maslow. We have a cognitive bias to over-rely on a familiar tool or paradigm. If you just learned React, you try to make your blog, your calculator, and your mother's recipe book into a Single Page Application (SPA).

**In Practice:**  
Learn multiple paradigms. Learn a scripting language, a systems language, and a functional language. The more tools you have in your belt, the less likely you are to use a hammer on a screw. Pick the right tool for the job, not just the one you like.
