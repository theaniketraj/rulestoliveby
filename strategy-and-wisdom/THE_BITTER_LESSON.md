# The Bitter Lesson

> "The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin."

**The Insight:**  
Rich Sutton argues that humans love to build their "clever" implementations into AI (hand-crafted features, chess strategies). But in the long run, simple, scalable algorithms (like search and learning) that can just consume massive computation always win. We cannot beat Moore's Law with cleverness.

**In Practice:**  
Don't hard-code human knowledge if you can avoid it. Build systems that can learn and scale with data and compute. Bet on the hardware getting faster, not on your algorithm being smarter than the universe.
