# Hanlon's Razor

> "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."

**The Insight:**  
Humans have a tendency to assume ill intent ("they did that to hurt me") when negative outcomes occur. However, most issues are caused by incompetence, ignorance, distraction, or simple mistakes. The world is rarely a conspiracy; it is more often a collection of people trying their best and occasionally failing.

**In Practice:**  
Cultivate intellectual charity. When a teammate breaks the build, a driver cuts you off, or a client sends a confusing email, assume it was a mistake rather than an attack. This mindset reduces stress and fosters a more collaborative, problem-solving environment. Ask "What happened?" instead of "Why did you do this?"
