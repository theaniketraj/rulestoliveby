# Wheaton's Law

> "Don't be a dick."

**The Insight:**  
Coined by Wil Wheaton, this is the golden rule of online communities (and life). Rules, terms of service, and constitutions are complex, but this simple heuristic covers 99% of social friction.

**In Practice:**  
In code reviews, in architecture debates, and in open source: attack the idea, not the person. Be kind. Assume good intent. Remember that there is a human on the other side of the screen.
