# The Pareto Principle (The 80/20 Rule)

> "For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes."

**The Insight:**
Inputs and outputs are rarely distributed evenly. A small fraction of your efforts usually yields the majority of your results.

**In Practice:**
Focus on the vital few, not the trivial many. In software, 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes. Fixing that top 20% yields the massive stability wins.
