# All Models Are Wrong (George Box's Law)

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

**The Insight:**  
A map is not the territory. Is a simplified subway map "wrong" because it doesn't show the exact curves of the tunnels? Yes. Is it "useful" for navigating the city? Absolutely. Every abstraction, every architecture diagram, and every mental model is a simplification of reality.

**In Practice:**  
Don't obsess over making a model perfect; focus on making it useful for the specific problem at hand. Accept the limitations of your abstractions. When the model stops being useful (e.g., the map doesn't show the construction detour), discard it for a better one or look at reality directly.
