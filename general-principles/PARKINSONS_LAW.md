# Parkinson's Law

> "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

**The Insight:**  
Time is a container, and work is a gas. If you allocate a week for a task that requires only a few hours, the psychological complexity and effort will expand to fill that entire week. This phenomenon, coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson, highlights that resource usage (time) is often determined by supply rather than demand.

**In Practice:**  
Leverage artificial constraints. Use "time-boxing" to set strict limits on how long you spend on tasks. If a meeting is scheduled for an hour but only needs 20 minutes, end it early. Impose aggressive (but realistic) deadlines to force prioritization and focus.
