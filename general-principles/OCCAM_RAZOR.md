# Occam's Razor

> "Entities should not be multiplied without necessity."

**The Insight:**  
When presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. Simplicity is often the hallmark of truth.

**In Practice:**  
Avoid over-engineering. If a simple script does the job, don't build a microservice architecture. Start simple and add complexity only when absolutely necessary.
