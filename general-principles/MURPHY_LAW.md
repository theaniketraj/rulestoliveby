# Murphy's Law

> "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."

**The Insight:**  
It’s not about pessimism; it’s about preparedness. Murphy's Law reminds us that complex systems have inherent failure points. If a outcome is possible, no matter how improbable, it eventually happens given enough time and opportunity.

**In Practice:**  
Design for failure. Build redundancy, meaningful error handling, and robust backups. Assume the database will crash, the network will flake, and the user will click the wrong button.
