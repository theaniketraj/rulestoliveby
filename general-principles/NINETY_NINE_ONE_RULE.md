# The 90-9-1 Rule (1% Rule)

> "In most online communities, 90% of users are lurkers, 9% are contributors, and 1% are creators."

**The Insight:**  
Participation in social systems follows a power law. The vast majority of people consume without contributing. A small group responds or edits. A tiny minority creates almost all the content. This "participation inequality" is consistent across wikis, forums, and social networks.

**In Practice:**  
Don't panic if your analytics show high traffic but low engagement; that's normal. Design for the lurkers (readability, search), nudge the contributors (easy upvotes, comments), and super-serve the creators (tools, recognition, status). If you want more creators, you must lower the barrier to entry significantly.
