# Hutber's Law

> "Improvement means deterioration."

**The Insight:**  
Proposed by economist Patrick Hutber, this cynicism-laced law observes that when a service claims to be "improved" or "modernized," it often means features are being removed or prices are being raised. In systems, optimization for one variable (e.g., profit, speed) often deteriorates others (e.g., quality, usability).

**In Practice:**  
Be wary of refactors or redesigns that are purely "strategic" without a clear user benefit. When you "improve" a system, check what you are losing. Are you removing a power-user feature to make the UI "cleaner"? You might be triggering Hutber's Law for your most loyal users.
