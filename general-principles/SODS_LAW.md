# Sod's Law

> "If something can go wrong, it will, at the worst possible time."

**The Insight:**  
A darker cousin of Murphy's Law. Murphy says "it will happen." Sod adds a dimension of malice: it will happen _exactly_ when you are presenting to the CEO, or 5 minutes before the deadline. It's the law of "Bad Luck."

**In Practice:**  
Don't test in production on Friday at 5 PM. Assume the worst timing will happen. Rehearse your demos. Have a backup laptop.
