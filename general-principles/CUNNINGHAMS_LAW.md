# Cunningham's Law

> "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

**The Insight:**  
People are more motivated by the urge to correct someone than by the urge to help someone. A question implies you don't know, which generates apathy. A wrong statement implies _you_ think you know but you're wrong, which generates "nerd fury" and an immediate correction.

**In Practice:**  
If you are stuck and need help, don't just say "How do I do X?" Instead, explain "I tried doing X by doing Y, but it didn't work because [plausible but wrong reason]." You will get faster, higher-quality, and more detailed technical answers.
