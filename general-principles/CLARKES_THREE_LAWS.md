# Clarke's Three Laws

> 1. "When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong."
> 2. "The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible."
> 3. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

**The Insight:**  
Arthur C. Clarke's laws remind us that our understanding of "possibility" is limited by our current paradigms. The third law is particularly potent: it explains why new tech feels miraculous to laypeople and why user interfaces should aim for "magical" simplicity where the mechanism is hidden.

**In Practice:**  
Be skeptical of "impossible." In software, if a senior engineer says "we can't do that," ask "is it physics or just difficult?" Strive to build software that feels like the Third Law: so seamless and intuitive that the user has no idea how complex the underlying engineering is.
