# The KISS Principle

> "Keep It Simple, Stupid."

**The Insight:**  
Complexity is the enemy of reliability. The more moving parts you have, the more likely something is to break. Simple systems are easier to understand, easier to maintain, and easier to extend.

**In Practice:**  
Don't use a factory pattern when a simple function will do. Don't build a microservice when a monolith will do. Ask yourself: "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?" Start there.
