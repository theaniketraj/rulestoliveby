# SOLID Principles

> A mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

1. **[Single Responsibility Principle](THE_SINGLE_RESPONSIBILITY_PRINCIPLE.md)**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
2. **[Open/Closed Principle](THE_OPEN_CLOSED_PRINCIPLE.md)**: Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **[Liskov Substitution Principle](THE_LISKOV_SUBSTITUTION_PRINCIPLE.md)**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
4. **[Interface Segregation Principle](THE_INTERFACE_SEGREGATION_PRINCIPLE.md)**: Operations should be specific to the client's needs.
5. **[Dependency Inversion Principle](THE_DEPENDENCY_INVERSION_PRINCIPLE.md)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

**The Insight:**  
Introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), these principles are the cornerstone of Object-Oriented Design (OOD). They prevent "spaghetti code" and allow systems to grow without collapsing under their own weight.
