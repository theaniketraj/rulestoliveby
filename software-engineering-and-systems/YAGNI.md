> "You Aren't Gonna Need It."

**The Insight:**  
A principle of Extreme Programming (XP). Developers often implement features "just in case" they need them later. These features rarely get used, but they always cost time to build, test, and maintain.

**In Practice:**  
Build for today's requirements, not next year's speculation. If you think "we might need a caching layer later," wait until you actually have a performance problem. The code you don't write is the only code that has zero bugs.
