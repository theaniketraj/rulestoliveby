# Gall's Law

> "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."

**The Insight:**  
You cannot design a complex system from scratch and expect it to work. It will fail. All successful complex systems (the Internet, the Amazon ecosystem, successful operating systems) started as simple, working kernels and evolved.

**In Practice:**  
Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Get a simple "Hello World" version working end-to-end before adding bells and whistles. Don't try to build the "ultimate platform" on day one.
