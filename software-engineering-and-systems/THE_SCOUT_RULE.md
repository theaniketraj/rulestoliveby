# The Scout Rule

> "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."

**The Insight:**  
Borrowed from the Boy Scouts, this rule is the antidote to technical debt (The Broken Windows Theory). You don't have to rewrite the entire module, but if you touch a file to fix a bug, improve one variable name, add one test, or delete one block of commented-out code.

**In Practice:**  
Continuous refactoring beats "The Big Rewrite." If everyone cleans up a little bit every day, the codebase improves over time. If everyone waits for "Refactoring Spring," the code rots.
