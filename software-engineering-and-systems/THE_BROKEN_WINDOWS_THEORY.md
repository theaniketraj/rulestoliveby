# The Broken Windows Theory

> "Visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes."

**The Insight:**  
In software, "broken windows" are bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code. If left unrepaired, they signal that "no one cares," encouraging developers to write more poor code.

**In Practice:**  
Fix bad code as soon as you see it. Do not let "temporary" hacks become permanent residents. Maintain a high standard of code hygiene to encourage everyone else to do the same.
