# Conway's Law

> "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs that are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

**The Insight:**  
The architecture of a software system reflects the social boundaries of the team that built it. If you have four teams working on a compiler, you’ll get a 4-pass compiler.

**In Practice:**  
If you want a specific architecture (e.g., microservices), you must align your organizational structure to support it (the "Inverse Conway Maneuver"). Don't fight the org chart with code; fix the org chart first.
