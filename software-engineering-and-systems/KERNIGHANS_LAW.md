# Kernighan's Law

> "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."

**The Insight:**  
Brian Kernighan warns against "clever" code. If you use every ounce of your mental energy to write a complex, optimized algorithm, you have no mental reserve left to understand it when it breaks. Complexity is a loan you take out against your future understanding.

**In Practice:**  
Write "boring" code. Favor readability over cleverness. If you must do something complex, document it excessively. The code you write today will be read by a stranger in six months, and that stranger is you. don't make them hate you.
