# The 90-90 Rule

> "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."

**The Insight:**  
Attributed to Tom Cargill at Bell Labs, this is a humorous look at software estimation. We are notoriously bad at estimating the "tail end" of a project—integration, edge cases, polish, and debugging. A project often feels "almost done" for half its lifespan.

**In Practice:**  
When your team says they are "90% done," assume they are halfway there. Double your estimates for the "finishing touches." The "happy path" is easy; the real work is in the error handling and the edge cases.
