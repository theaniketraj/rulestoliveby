# Linus's Law

> "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

**The Insight:**  
Formulated by Eric S. Raymond about Linus Torvalds' management of the Linux kernel. In a closed system, finding a bug is a hard, solitary task. In an open system, diverse backgrounds and divergent perspectives mean that what is obscure to one person is obvious to another.

**In Practice:**  
Code reviews are not just a formality; they are the application of "more eyeballs." Open source your non-critical components if possible. Within your team, encourage pair programming and rotating knowledge so that no part of the system is a "black box" known only to one person.
