# Koomey's Law

> "The energy efficiency of computers (computations per joule) doubles roughly every 1.57 years."

**The Insight:**  
While Moore's Law is about speed/density, Koomey's Law is about efficiency. This is why we have smartphones. A battery-powered device today has the power of a supercomputer from 1990 because it does the same math with a fraction of the electricity.

**In Practice:**  
For mobile and IoT, energy is the constraint, not speed. Optimizing your code for energy (sleeping inputs, batching networks calls) is critical. As Moore's Law slows, Koomey's Law becomes the primary driver of value in edge computing.
