# Brooks' Law

> "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."

**The Insight:**  
Software development is not a factory line. New people take time to ramp up (taking time away from existing team members for training) and communication overhead increases quadratically with team size ($n(n-1)/2$).

**In Practice:**  
Resist the urge to throw bodies at a deadline. It almost always generates negative productivity in the short term.
