# The Dead Sea Effect

> "The more talented and employable you are, the more likely you are to leave. The less talented you are, the more likely you are to stay."

**The Insight:**  
Bruce Webster observed that in toxic or stagnant organizations, the "water" evaporates (talent leaves because they can get jobs elsewhere). The "salt" remains (the untalented or mediocre stay because they can't leave). Over time, the organization becomes a "Dead Sea" of high salinity (low talent density), making it even harder to hire new talent.

**In Practice:**  
Retention is not a single number. You must measure distinct retention rates for your _top_ performers vs. your bottom performers. If your best people are leaving and your worst are staying, you are dying.
