# Dunbar's Number

> "Humans can maintain a stable social network of approximately 150 individuals."

**The Insight:**  
Our primate brains have a hardware limit on the number of relationships we can manage. Beyond ~150, we stop treating people as unique individuals and start treating them as "groups" or stereotypes.

**In Practice:**  
If your company or department grows beyond 150, you _must_ implement formal process, hierarchy, and explicit communication structures. The high-trust, "everyone knows everyone" startup culture _will_ break at this point. Prepare for it by splitting into smaller, autonomous tribes (see The Two Pizza Rule).
