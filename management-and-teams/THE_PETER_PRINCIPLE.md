# The Peter Principle

> "In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

**The Insight:**  
Laurence J. Peter observed that employees are promoted based on their performance in their _current_ role, not their aptitude for the _next_ one. If you are a great coder, you get promoted to manager. But managing requires different skills. If you aren't a good manager, you stop getting promoted, but you stay in the role you are bad at. Thus, over time, organizations fill up with people stuck at their level of incompetence.

**In Practice:**  
Separate the "Management" track from the "Individual Contributor" track. Allow great engineers to advance in career and pay without forcing them to manage people. As an individual, be self-aware: only accept a promotion if you are willing to learn the _new_ skills it requires, not just because it's the only way to get a raise.
