# The Spotify Model

> "Aligned autonomy: Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds."

**The Insight:**  
Spotify scaled agile by creating a matrix structure.

- **Squads:** Small, cross-functional teams with end-to-end responsibility (Vertical).
- **Tribes:** Collections of Squads working in the same business area.
- **Chapters:** Functional groups (e.g., "All Backend Engineers") within a Tribe to ensure quality and hiring standards (Horizontal).
- **Guilds:** Communities of interest across the whole company (e.g., "Java Guild").

**In Practice:**  
Don't just copy "Squads" and expect magic. The core insight is _autonomy with alignment_. Teams (Squads) decide _how_ to solve a problem, while Leadership provides the strategic _what_ and _why_. Functional managers (Chapter Leads) focus on people growth, not daily task assignment.
