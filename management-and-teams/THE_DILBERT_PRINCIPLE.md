# The Dilbert Principle

> "The most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage: management."

**The Insight:**  
Scott Adams' satirical observation that companies promote incompetent employees to management to get them out of the workflow. While cynical, it explains why "management" often seems disconnected from the reality of the work.

**In Practice:**  
If you find yourself surrounded by incompetent management, you might be in a "Dilbert" organization. As a leader, ensure you are promoting people because they have leadership skills, not just to remove them from a coding role they are bad at.
