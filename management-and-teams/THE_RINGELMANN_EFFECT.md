# The Ringelmann Effect (Social Loafing)

> "The tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases."

**The Insight:**  
Discovered by Max Ringelmann in a rope-pulling experiment. One person pulls 100%. Two people pull 93% each. Eight people pull only 49% each. In large groups, individual contribution becomes invisible, leading to "social loafing."

**In Practice:**  
Keep teams small (Amazon's Two Pizza Rule). Ensure individual accountability. If a task is assigned to "the team," nobody does it. Assign it to a specific person.
