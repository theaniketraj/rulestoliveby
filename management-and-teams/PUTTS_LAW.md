# Putt's Law

> "Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage, and those who manage what they do not understand."

**The Insight:**  
The corporate world separates skills into "Technical" and "Management." As you climb the ladder, you manage more but code less. Eventually, organizations end up with decision-makers who don't understand the tech, and techies who have no power to decide.

**In Practice:**  
Bridge the gap. If you are a manager, trust your experts (don't pretend to be one). If you are an expert, learn to communicate in "business speak" so the managers can make the right decisions.
