# The Two Pizza Rule

> "A team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas."

**The Insight:**  
Popularized by Jeff Bezos at Amazon, this rule fights the law of diminishing returns in communication. As a team grows, the number of communication links grows quadratically ($n(n-1)/2$). Large teams spend more time coordinating than creating. A team of 6-8 people is the sweet spot for autonomy, speed, and shared context.

**In Practice:**  
If a meeting has so many people that you'd need a catering service, it's probably a broadcast, not a discussion. Break monolithic teams into small, cross-functional squads with end-to-end ownership of a specific feature or service. Empower them to move fast without needing permission from the "central committee."
